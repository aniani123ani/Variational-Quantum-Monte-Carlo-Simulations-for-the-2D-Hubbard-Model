# Variational-Quantum-Monte-Carlo-Simulations-for-the-2D-Hubbard-Model 

Description:
In this project, I implemented a Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulation for the 2D Hubbard Model to study strongly correlated electron systems. The simulation employs the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to decouple the interaction term, allowing for an efficient Monte Carlo sampling of auxiliary fields. The Green's function is computed using matrix exponentiation techniques, and updates are performed using the Metropolis algorithm.

This work is based on the paper:
S. R. White and A. L. Chernyshev, Variational quantum Monte Carlo simulations with tensor-network states, arXiv:0708.2232.
